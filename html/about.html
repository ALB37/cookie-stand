      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Our glorious founder Pat (pictured above with his family) opened his first cookie stand in Seattle's legendary Pike Place Market, on Pike and 1st in downtown Seattle. We started out as a small business with a big idea: "What if we married two Seattle classics?" The robust flavor of Salmon and the perfect pastry companion for a cup of gourmet Seattle joe... and a legend was born. Our secret method grinds real wild salmon fish so finely, that it can't even be tasted. And it is the perfect treat when you are enjoying a cup of Seattle coffee! Our vision spread like fire and caught the imagination of locals and tourists alike. Now with over 4 locations (we have 5) in the Seattle area, make sure you stop by and see what all the ruckus is about!
